     <strong>I'm Surely Not High</strong> is a puzzle-platformer with unique mechanic, puzzle game that still on development with more than 40+ level to beat. Built collaboratively in Unity using its Version Control system. This project showcases my teamwork in a distributed development environment, proficiency with Unity's VCS, and ability to design engaging gameplay mechanics and unique levels.

     <br> I really love this game and I'm so proud of it. I could write about it for hours. Designing levels and mechanics that challenge players while keeping the experience fun and rewarding has been a thrilling journey.

        <strong>God Jammit</strong> is a 2D point-and-shoot entry for BGDJam 2025 that won first place! Built in just three days in Unity, the game challenges players with unpredictably jamming weapons, forcing on-the-fly strategy shifts. Featuring multiple upgradable weapons and dynamic wave-based combat. This jam project highlights my rapid prototyping skills, balanced gameplay design, and ability to polish a game under intense time constraints.

        We receive a prize from the jam organizer as a winner of BGDJam 2025 (Rp 1.500.000), and I'm so proud of it.

    Built in just 2 days for Micro Jam 040 (theme: Magic — “Death is your friend”), There's embedded MiniScript directly into the game so players can author and run their own spell code through a safe, sandboxed API wired to game events and stats. This scripting-first approach flips failure into progress, encouraging playful experimentation where your code drives buffs, automations, and clever solutions. The project earned 2nd place overall and 1st in the Best MiniScript Entry category.
